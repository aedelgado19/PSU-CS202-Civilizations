   This project is a Civilization game in which the user can 
   build and play as different civilization types: agricultural,
   military, and industrial. Each civilization type has different
   strengths and weaknesses, starting resources, and skills.
   Main.cpp acts as the client for gameplay. The rules of
   the game play are displayed when the client runs the game
   and selects "rules".
